# SearchGraph.py
#
# Implementation of iterative deepening search for use in finding optimal routes
# between locations in a graph. In the graph to be searched, nodes have names
# (e.g. city names for a map).
#
# An undirected graph is passed in as a text file (first command line argument). 
#
# Usage: python SearchGraph.py graphFile startLocation endLocation
